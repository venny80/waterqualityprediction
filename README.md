#  Water Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
Water pollution is a serious environmental challenge that affects human health and aquatic ecosystems. Manual water quality monitoring is time-consuming and costly. This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict water quality based on various chemical and physical parameters, enabling faster and data-driven assessment of water conditions.

This project was developed as part of the **AICTE – Edunet Foundation – Shell Skills4Future Internship (Green Skills)**.

##  Objective
- To analyze water quality data
- To build a machine learning model that predicts water quality status
- To compare different ML algorithms and identify the best-performing model

---

##  Dataset Description
The dataset consists of water quality parameters commonly used in environmental monitoring:

- Ammonium (NH₄)
- Dissolved Oxygen (O₂)
- Nitrates (NO₃)
- Nitrites (NO₂)
- Phosphates (PO₄)
- Sulphates (SO₄)
- Chlorides (Cl)
- Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD / BSK5)
- Suspended Solids

These parameters help determine the pollution level and overall health of water bodies.
